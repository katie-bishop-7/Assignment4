Project Requirements:

When user presses a key, the key goes down on the screen

When user unpresses a key, the key goes up on the screen

When user presses shift, shift key goes down and abc keys go uppercase, number keys get swapped for second set along with misc RHS keys

When an uppercase letter must be typed, the shift goes red. 

When a lowercase letter must be typed and the shift is being held down, nothing is red. 

When a lowercase letter must be typed, it is highlighted in red.

When the correct character is typed, it goes black and the next letter is underlined. This goes for spaces too.

when an incorrect character is typed, the key goes down but nothing else changes. User does not move on to next letter if previous was incorrect.

When done typing the current phrase, phrase is reset and first letter is underlined.
